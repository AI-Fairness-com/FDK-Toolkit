## üåç Overview

The **FDK‚Ñ¢ Toolkit** enables non-technical professionals, regulators, and educators to test and interpret algorithmic fairness **without coding**.  
It offers *domain-specific APIs*, *automatic feature detection*, and *plain-language audit reports* in JSON and human-readable form.

Each domain API operates through the [AI Fairness Portal](https://www.ai-fairness.com)  
and can also be run locally for demonstration or research purposes.
