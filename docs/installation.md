🧰 FDK™ Toolkit — Installation Guide
This document provides the installation procedure for running the Fairness Diagnostic Kit (FDK™) locally for research, education, or demonstration purposes.
All instructions reflect the current public repository structure and configuration.
1. System Requirements
1.1 Operating System
FDK™ is platform-independent and runs on:
macOS
Linux
Windows (with Python installed)
1.2 Python Version
The toolkit requires:
Python 3.10.x
The exact version (3.10.13) is defined in the repository’s .python-version file.
1.3 Python Dependencies
Required packages are listed in requirements.txt and include:
Flask
Flask-CORS
Flask-Session
NumPy
Pandas
scikit-learn
SciPy
Installation instructions follow below.
2. Clone the Repository
Open a terminal and run:
git clone https://github.com/AI-Fairness-com/FDK-Toolkit.git
cd FDK-Toolkit
3. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
If multiple Python versions are installed on the machine, use:
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Toolkit Locally
To start the FDK™ local server:
python app.py
or, if needed:
python3 app.py
The Flask application will start and provide access to all seven domain audit interfaces.
5. Accessing Domain-Specific Audit Pages
Each domain has its own upload route:
/business-upload
/education-upload
/finance-upload
/health-upload
/hiring-upload
/justice-upload
/governance-upload
These interfaces allow you to:
Upload a CSV dataset
Review automatically detected mappings
Run domain-specific fairness audits
Download structured JSON audit reports
View plain-language summaries generated by the corresponding pipeline
6. Optional: Deploying FDK™ on Render
The repository contains a render.yaml file specifying:
Python version
Install command
Start command
Render will automatically build and serve the application based on this configuration.
7. Dataset Requirements
To ensure safe and compliant operation:
Datasets must be provided in CSV format
All personal identifiers must be removed
Columns should represent:
Sensitive group attributes
Ground-truth outcome (y_true)
Model predictions (y_pred)
Optional probability scores (y_prob)
FDK™ automatically detects these features during upload.
8. Troubleshooting
“No module named X”
Run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Python not found
Use:
python3 app.py
Flask app not starting
Ensure you are inside the repository directory:
cd FDK-Toolkit
