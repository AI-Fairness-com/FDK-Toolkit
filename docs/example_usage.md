# 🧪 FDK™ Example Usage Guide

[![License: Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache--2.0-green.svg)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

This guide provides clear, practical examples of how to use each FDK™ domain interface.  
The examples follow the upload → auto-confirm → fairness audit → JSON report workflow used across all seven domains.

---

## 🌍 Overview

Every FDK™ domain follows the same operational pattern:

1. Upload a **de-identified CSV dataset**
2. FDK™ automatically detects:
   - Sensitive group attributes  
   - Outcome (`y_true`)  
   - Model predictions (`y_pred`)  
   - Optional probability scores (`y_prob`)
3. User confirms or adjusts detected mappings
4. Domain-specific fairness metrics are calculated
5. A human-readable summary and detailed JSON report are generated

This document demonstrates these steps using example datasets.

Disparate Impact Ratio: 0.734

Composite Bias Score: 0.1793

Severity: HIGH_BIAS

1️⃣ Business Domain — Example Workflow
📁 Uploading the dataset
Navigate to:

/business-upload

Upload a CSV file with columns such as:

Gender

Ethnicity

CustomerServiceOutcome

ModelPrediction

ProbabilityScore

FDK™ automatically detects appropriate mappings.

🔍 Auto-Confirmed Mappings
The system displays:

Group attributes: Gender, Ethnicity

Outcome column: CustomerServiceOutcome

Prediction column: ModelPrediction

Probability column (optional): ProbabilityScore

You may adjust these if needed.

▶️ Running the Fairness Audit
Select "Run Fairness Audit".
The Business pipeline calculates fairness metrics, including:

Statistical Parity Difference

Disparate Impact Ratio

TPR / FPR / FNR gaps

Calibration differences

Balanced accuracy differences
