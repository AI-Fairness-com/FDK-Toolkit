# 🧪 FDK™ Example Usage Guide

[![License: Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache--2.0-green.svg)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

This guide provides clear, practical examples of how to use each FDK™ domain interface.  
The examples follow the upload → auto-confirm → fairness audit → JSON report workflow used across all seven domains.

## 🌍 Overview

Every FDK™ domain follows the same operational pattern:

1. Upload a **de-identified CSV dataset**
2. FDK™ automatically detects:
   - Sensitive group attributes  
   - Outcome (`y_true`)  
   - Model predictions (`y_pred`)  
   - Optional probability scores (`y_prob`)
3. User confirms or adjusts detected mappings
4. Domain-specific fairness metrics are calculated
5. A human-readable summary and detailed JSON report are generated

# 🚀 Jupyter Notebook Demo — Justice Domain  
📓 **Interactive Tutorial Now Available**

A complete, hands-on Jupyter notebook is now available to demonstrate the **entire Justice domain fairness audit workflow**.

Access the demo:

```bash
# Justice domain interactive notebook
demos/FDK_Justice_Demo.ipynb
🎯 What the Demo Includes
Full Justice Pipeline Execution — 36+ fairness metrics
COMPAS-like Dataset Analysis — Demonstrates realistic justice-sector bias patterns
Interactive Visualisations — Group distributions, error gaps, DI ratios
Legal Compliance Assessment — Includes 80% rule checks
Exportable Audit Reports — Generates JSON fairness audit files
🔬 Key Features Demonstrated
Example of justice-specific metrics computed by the notebook:
# Sample fairness metrics from the demo
- Statistical Parity Difference: 0.165
- Disparate Impact Ratio: 0.734   # ❌ below 0.80 (legal threshold)
- Composite Bias Score: 0.1793
- Severity: HIGH_BIAS  # Requires immediate review
📊 Sample Output Generated by the Notebook
The demo provides:
Visual analysis of demographic disparities
Interpretive commentary for justice-sector use
Legal and ethical analysis based on fairness standards
Actionable fairness recommendations
Regulatory-ready documentation outputs
🎮 Try It Yourself
Open the notebook:
demos/FDK_Justice_Demo.ipynb
Run all cells to execute the complete justice fairness audit
Modify the synthetic dataset to explore different bias patterns
Export the JSON audit file for your own documentation or teaching
Use Colab/Jupyter for highly interactive exploration
1️⃣ Business Domain — Example Workflow
📁 Uploading the dataset
Navigate to:
/business-upload
Upload a CSV file with columns such as:
Gender
Ethnicity
CustomerServiceOutcome
ModelPrediction
ProbabilityScore
FDK™ automatically detects appropriate mappings.
🔍 Auto-Confirmed Mappings
The system displays:
Group attributes: Gender, Ethnicity
Outcome column: CustomerServiceOutcome
Prediction column: ModelPrediction
Probability column (optional): ProbabilityScore
You may adjust these if needed.
▶️ Running the Fairness Audit
Select “Run Fairness Audit”.
The Business pipeline calculates fairness metrics, including:
Statistical Parity Difference
Disparate Impact Ratio
TPR / FPR / FNR gaps
Calibration differences
Balanced accuracy differences
📄 Example JSON Output (Excerpt)
{
  "domain": "Business",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",

Key disparities
Groups most affected
Direction of bias
Summary of potential risks
Contextual interpretation based on the Business domain
